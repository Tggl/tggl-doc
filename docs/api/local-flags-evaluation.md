# Evaluating flags locally

<Image img={require('./assets/local-flags-evaluation.png')} density={1} />


:::info
You **should not** evaluate flags locally on client side applications to 
prevent 
exposing sensitive information to the client.

On the backend side it is recommended to always evaluate flags 
[via the API](api-flags-evaluation) unless you have performance issues when evaluating 
flags at a high frequency, or if you need to split traffic on the edge 
without doing an API call.

Evaluating flags locally forces you to maintain a copy of flags 
configuration up to date and potentially re-implement the evaluation logic in 
your language, which might be a source of issues.
:::

## Retrieving the configuration

The <Api method="GET" url="/config" /> endpoint allows you to retrieve all 
active flag's configurations at once, making it possible to then evaluate an extremely high number of flags locally without doing any API calls.


```bash
curl 'https://api.tggl.io/config' \
  -H 'x-tggl-api-key: <server api key>'
```

The response is a JSON array containing all active flags:
```json
[
  {
    "slug": "flagA",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "rules": [
          {
            "key": "userId",
            "operator": "STR_EQUAL",
            "negate": false,
            "values": [
              "u1",
              "u2"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "variation": {
          "active": true,
          "value": "foo"
        }
      }
    ],
    "defaultVariation": {
      "active": false,
      "value": null
    }
  },
  {
    "slug": "flagB",
    "conditions": [],
    "defaultVariation": {
      "active": true,
      "value": "bar"
    }
  }
]
```

If you are using Node you can use the [Node.js client](/docs/sdks/list/node) to query the configuration and parse the result.
Otherwise you should refer to the [reference implementation](https://github.com/Tggl/tggl-core) written in Javascript to
parse the result in your own programming language.

## When to retrieve the configuration?

You have only a few solutions to maintain the cache of the configuration up to 
date:
- Manually refresh the cache when you update a flag
- Automatically refresh the cache at a regular interval
- Use a webhook to update the cache when a flag is updated

It is recommended to use a [webhook](./webhooks) as it offers the fastest 
automatic update.
