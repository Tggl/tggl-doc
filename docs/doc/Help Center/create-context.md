To create a Context, you need to: 
1. Look for the **Context** tab in the left menu on the Tggl application and click on it. 
2. Once you are on the Context page, you will find a blue **+New** button. Click on it to start creating a new context.
3. A modal window will appear, allowing you to configure the new context property: 
    - Start by entering a name for the Context property.
    - Next, provide a Context key for the property.
    - Add a description to provide additional information or details about the property
    - Select the type of property from the available options. The type determines the format and validation rules for the property.
    
    Types available for the context property include: String, Select, Number, Boolean, Date, Version, and Array.

4. Once youâ€™re done with the configuration, click on the **Create Property** button to save the context property.
