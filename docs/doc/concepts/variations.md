# Variations

## Overview

Variations are a way to create multiple versions of a single feature. Most 
feature only have 2 variations: enabled and disabled for toggling a feature, or 
green and blue for testing the color of a button. However, sometimes you 
may want to have more than 2 variations.

For instance, you may want to test 3 different colors for a button: green, 
blue, and red. Or you may want to limit the number of invitations a user can 
send out to 3, 5, 10, or any other number you can think of, you are not 
limited in the number of variations you can create.
