# Remote config

## Overview

Usually, changing a simple configuration value in your application requires changing a config file in the codebase and triggering a new release. Not only does does it have a negative impact the productivity of your team, but it also takes quite a long time to go from "wanting the change to be made" all the way to "seeing hte change in production".

Remote config allows developers and non-technical people alike to modify various aspects of your app without requiring any code change or lengthy deployment process. It provides flexibility and enables real-time configuration changes, allowing you to control the application's behavior, appearance, and other parameters remotely.


Remote config is commonly used in mobile app development, where deployment cycles are extremely slow and expensive, needing to be validated by Apple or Google, and then waiting for your users to update the app which you can never really control. Remote config allows you to change the app's behavior instantly, without requiring users to update their software at all.
